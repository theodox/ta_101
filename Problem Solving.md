# Problem Solving

These questions investigate the candidate’s approach to roadblocks: are they good at self-teaching, chasing down information, and making decisions – or do they need to be told what to do? Can they analyze and solve complex problems? How do they deal with ambiguity and time pressure? 

1. What was the trickiest pipeline you ever had to work with? How did you go about designing it? How did you iterate with the art team to improve the workflow? 
    - Likely a mid to senior question, presupposes a few years of production experience
    - “Trickiest” here can mean many things; it could be impossible performance requirements or target technology that was unstable, but it could also be a team where politics made it hard to adopt best practices, or a legacy tech that required strange workarounds. The choice of “trickiest” can give an insight into the candidate’s outlook: are the hardest problems technical or social? Are the solutions coming from new tech, new workflows, or sheer effort?
    - If the negotiations that led to the final outcome were complex, what insight does this give you to the candidate’s approach to collaboration?
    - Does the discussion show a good understanding of the underlying tech? Or is the solution messy because nobody on the team was able to analyze the problem successfully? 
    - Is the solution a radical tech moonshot, or creative lateral thinking, or powering through by brute force? 
    - Did the candidate fight to make things user friendly?
    - Did they take a lot of thankless tasks to be supportive of their teammates?
    - Or, did they just demand that the artists follow orders?
    - Don't be afraid to dig in on technical detail, this is a concrete situation where the candidate's skills can be seen in action. How good was their solution given the constraints they faced? 

2. What’s the most obscure or difficult problem you ever had to debug? Tell me how you figured it out.
    - This doesn’t have to mean code debugging – a lighting artist trying to understand why some combination of settings produces bad results is “debugging” in this sense.
    - What level of technical insight does the candidate show as they explain the problem? This can be a good window into their technical experience. Is this a problem that would stump experts, or should it have been easier to solve than the candidate makes out? 
    - Did they teach themselves what they needed to know, or did they rely on finding the right colleague?
    - Does the candidate prefer to handle problems solo, or to assemble a team to find answers?
    - If resolving the issue involves team conflicts, you may be able to add a followup question from the “Collaboration” section to get at the candidate’s approach to teamwork.
    - Potentially, you could ask this as “Out of all the problems you’ve had to debug, which one are you proudest of figuring out?”

3. Tell me about a time when you were given a task that was outside your comfort zone. How did you react? What steps did you take to deal with the situation?
    - This can be a good task for younger TAs, since it’s not really specific to industry experience. For a young person an answer about a class where everybody else had better preparation can be a valid answer.
    - Dealing with this kind of situation is a great showcase for the candidate's resilience in ambiguous situations.
    - Answers could skew technical or be mostly interpersonal. Is the answer part of a larger pattern in the candidate’s approach to teamwork?
    - Does the candidate find the information they need to survive in a tough situation? Finding an engineer to teach you or reading the docs or googling your way into competence are all valid strategies for a TA who is able to show self-help in a tight spot. Is this person able to rise to the challenge of ambiguity and imperfect information? 
    - Finding a collaborator to help with the hard part can show mature willingness to acknowledge limits, or it could show helplessness. 
    - What is the balance between focusing on getting the job done by any means (overtime, manual work), on-the-fly learning, and the ability to find support from teammates?   
    
4. Have you ever been involved with a project that really fell short of its potential or just plain failed? What did you learn from that failure?
    - This question is not great for younger TAs, since they may not have enough experience to answer and may be very self conscious about being associated with “failure.”
    - It’s instructive to see what people focus on in their postmortem analysis: Are they able to look at it dispassionately or are they prone to blaming themselves? Others? Fate? 
    - Do follow–up questions reveal a candidate who is able to learn from missteps? The best test for resilience is whether the candidate learns and grows after hitting a roadblock.
    - Another good follow up is “if you knew then what you know now, what would you do differently?” This is particularly useful for senior candidates, since it can let them show growth over the course of their own career.

5. What is your favorite crazy hack solution to a production problem?
    - The emphasis here is on hack – this is not “what is your proudest technology moment?” it’s more like “when were you able to pull something off that by rights should have been impossible.” The emphasis is on cleverness and mental agility, not pure technical skill.
    - Sharing a hacky story of your own can be a good icebreaker when transitioning into a technical stretch of the interview – it’s less threatening than a serious tech question and helps lighten the mood. 
    - Pay attention to how they set up the story: what does it say about their ability to analyze and describe a complex problem? 
    - One potential red flag here is a hack that was slipped into a project illicitly – does the candidate take production discipline and release management too lightly? 
    - For younger candidates this can provide a useful indirect view of their technical foundations – is the hack there because it is creative problem solving, or because they don’t know the right way to achieve their goals?
    - For senior candidates a "hack" can be a completely legitimate humblebrag: a bit of cleverness predicated on deep domain knowledge might not be great engineering practice but it really shows depth. 

6. Have you ever worked with somebody who had a lot of trouble unblocking themself? Were you able to help them become more self-supporting? If so, how?
    - This is not a great question for younger TAs who have not worked with a lot of people.
    - The surface value of this question is how it shows the candidate’s ability to build relationships and communicate with teammates who may have a very different outlook and skills sets.
    - Indirectly this question is good for showing how the candidate approaches ambiguity: do they have empathy for people who don’t “get it?” Or are they impatient with people who don’t share their knowledge and skills?
    - Does the way they approached their colleague indicate an unbiased, empathetic approach?  
    - Does the story indicate a willingness to try different approaches to reach different audiences?
