# Leadership

Although this section is primarily for manager candidates, several of the questions here are good markers for senior candidates who are going to provide informal leadership in IC roles as well.  These questions are even more story-based than other areas. Here we are trying to find people who know how to balance accountability for results with a positive, supportive work environment.  A key component of interviewing here is understanding what the manager's core values will be: when things get tough, what will they fight to protect and what will they 

Typically only about half of a manager interview will be “unique” to managers – collaboration and team behaviors from section one should take up maybe the first 5-10 minutes of an interview; domain, tech and industry questions should account for another 15-20 minutes, leaving 20-30 minutes for management specific questions.

1. How do you balance your identity as a tech artist and your identity as a manager? What challenges come with spending more time on people and less time on code or content?    
    - This is generally an easy warmup question for manager candidates
    - How does the candidate view leadership transition - would they really rather be an IC?
    - If they want to manage, is it because they enjoy empowering people? Or because they equate a manager title with power?
    - Are they working to stay current on the tech part of their identity?
    - What is the meaning they assign to "manager?" Are they thinking of it in terms of scheduling and tasking, "personnel management", or leadership? 

2. What part of being a manager do you like the least?  What have you done to try to make it easier on yourself?
    - Is candidate uncomfortable delivering feedback? Or do they hate having to manage time and money constraints? Do they dislike bureaucracy? Are they averse to process?
    - Have they taken steps to learn better ways to deal? Do they read management books, take classes, or go to GDC looking to improve their skills?
    - Sometimes this will reflect the human cost of dealing with real-life crises, for example a teammate becoming ill. Beyond the stress and complexity that come with an out-of-work crisis, what does this reveal about the candidate's character: when their employees need help, do they take extra steps to try to help or are they focused on time and money issues back in the office?
    - This may lead to a discussion of crunch culture and how to combat it.
    - This might also speak to IC / Manager tension: is the person nostalgic for the simplicity of IC work? Will they perhaps neglect messy human problems to focus on technical issues when things get tough?  
    
3. … and what is the best part of being a manager?            
    - This is a natural followup to the previous question. It's very helpful for understanding core values.
    - Is this someone who enjoys fostering professional growth?
    - Are they extra thoughtful about creating a positive culture?
    - Do they work particularly hard on inclusion?
    - Are they most proud of solving production problems and shipping things?
    - Are they primarily invested in growing their own influence inside the company?

4. What’s the best thing one of your managers ever did for you?
    - What values come out of “best”? Does the candidate see this as personal support, as education, as empowerment?
    - Do they explicitly intend to be like that great manager?
    - Did they learn good lessons about coaching, empathy, or navigating production problems?
    - Conversely if they don't have anything good to say about a past manager, what motivates them to become a manager themselves? Are they too quick to assume their past managers were inadquate?

5. Tell me about your coaching style – how do you help your employees grow? How do you adapt to employees with different learning styles?
    - Positives are flexibility, accommodates a wide range of learning styles, and willingness to learn in order to teach
    - Downers: not interested, “it gets in the way”, trying to push people down paths they really don’t want or need.
    - Are they willing to be vulnerable and confess ignorance in front of juniors?
    - Do they go out of their way to find resources (course material, specialist mentors, learning opportunities) for employees?
    
6. Tell me about a time when you struggled to get an employee past a career roadblock, like being hung up on a skill they could not seem to master or persistent trouble collaborating effectively.  What did you try to help them with? What didn't work? What finally resolved the situation? 
    - Details will obviously be quite varied, but there are several potential themes to observe:
        - For a social or collaborative problem, were the steps taken reasonable escalations? Or did the situation become critical very fast?
        - For a learning or technical problem, how many different approaches were tried? Is there evidence of patience and willingess to experiment, or was the candidate quick to decide somebody was a lost cause?
    - Often these stories end with an employee exit. How does the candidate reflect on that outcome? Do they think the final outcome was the best realistic option? Do they see it as a failure on their own part, or on the employee's, or as just a routine business transaction? 

  6. Do you find it a challenge to keep your team informed about what the rest of the company’s up to, and to keep other parts of the company up to date on your team’s work? How do you prefer to handle information flow?
    -  Ideally the candidate is excited about making sure that information is flowing freely – information hoarding is a red flag here. 
    - How do they identify silos or missing context, and what do they do to make sure information is not getting buried?
    - Are they thoughtful about balancing process-oriented solutions (regular newsletters, status meetings, show-and-tells) with the need to let people focus on work?
    - What does their answer say about the use (and abuse) of meetings as a way to spread information? Do they have a philosophy about what kind of topics are worth a zoom session and which can be handled in some non-blocking way?
    - Are they self-conscious about the challenges of remote work? What does their answer say about how they will connect with teammates in different time zones or on different schedules? 

  7. Have you ever had to deal with a “talented jerk” as a manager or a teammate? How did you handle that? If you had to approach the same situation again today, what would you do differently?
    -  Are they able to get value out of a prickly colleague without sacrificing good collaborative behavior?
    - Did they try to provide coaching on how to do better, or did they work around the problem instead of "solving" i? 
    - Is the candidate introspective about how they could improve their own approach in future? Or do they place 100% of the blame on the other person?
    - What does the response say about the way the candidate balances the need for quality tech work and the need for a functional team culture?

  8. Out of all the different methodologies out there – Agile, Scrum, Waterfall, Extreme – what is your preferred method for getting things done, and why?
    - The “why” is really the key question here, since not everybody will have experienced more than one
    - You may get interesting but not super relevant stuff about “Agile” vs “Scrum”
    - Good things to look for:
        - Pragmatism
        - Flexibility
        - Somebody who ships… but with sustainable work practices, not a deathmarch mentality
        - Wants a plan, but recognizes plans change
    - Red flags
        - Impatient with process of any kind
        - Allergic to planning
        - Over-optimistic belief in the ability to predict and pre-solve problems 

  9. What makes you want to be a manager? 
    - Key things to look for:
        - Do they see management as synonymous with power?
        - Are they more interested in heading into management, or in getting out of production?
        - Is this an experiment or part of a thought-out transition plan?
    - For juniors, a good follow up is “What is there about management that you don’t think you know? What are you most curious to find out about?"
    - For seniors, this can be a good sidelight on career aspirations. Is this about passing the torch to new workers? Or about climbing the corporate ladder? Or about empowering colleagues to do great things?


  10. What was the hardest thing you ever had to do as a manager?
    - The stories here can vary a lot – firing or laying people off, for example, is traumatic but you may hear stories about marriages failing, people being ill, businesses collapsing or projects imploding
        - Where does this candidate draw the line between pragmatism and empathy? Have they had to make hard choices, and if so were they able to do it without being overwhelmed
        - Does the story indicate a supportive manager who will work hard to protect their team?
        - Is this person willing to confront leadership in the company on behalf of their team? 
    - This could also be a more situational answer “the hardest thing I ever had to do was to ship ______ without a graphics lead.” 
        - Does the story show creative problem solving and leadership under fire?
        - How much credit does the story give to the team, and how much reflects well (or too well) on the manager?
