# Collaboration and Communication

These questions concern the way the candidate fits into a team environment: how well they work with different disciplines, their approach to communication, and their ability to solve problems collaboratively. 
Many of these questions relate very directly to workplace values and leadership skills, so they offer good starting points for different values-based parts of the interview loop.


1. Tell me about a situation where you think a bias had a negative impact on some of your teammates or on the product you were working on. What steps did you take? What did you learn from it? 
    -  As a standalone question this can feel forced. It can be a lot more powerful if you can insert investigations of bias into follow-up on other answers where team interactions are at play. (“Do you think there were issues of bias at play in that team…?”).  
    - Does the answer line up well with your team's approach to inclusion? Followup discussion is a good opportunity to discuss how your team or commpany combats biases.
    - If the candidate was a bystander, did they intervene directly? Did they report bad behavior but try to let someone else resolve the situation? 
    - The story might be from a long time ago; have they learned anything since which has changed their attitude towards their own role in the situation?
    - If the answer is very personal, it's a good idea to listen supportively without trying to offer too much commentary. 
    - Biases come in lots of forms! Problems confronted in Europe might be quite different from those in the US. But empathy, openness and willingness to reflect are universally useful.

2. How do you go about fitting in when you joined a new company or got a new role? How do you figure out how the team and the project really work?
    - This is a good one to customize based on your own experience and their resume – most of us have had that feeling of feeling stranded or overwhelmed by a new environment. It can be a good way to connect with the candidate, so it’s often a good early question.
    - Does the candidate’s response illustrate self-teaching and adaptability? What level of handholding do they expect? 
    - What does their approach to a new environment suggest about their learning style?
    - Do they start with technical problems or with team relationships? 

3. What is your favorite example of a work environment where the collaboration was really effective? What made that experience so special?
    - This question is better for senior candidates, since beginners may not have much to go on besides a student project. “How did your student project team work together? What worked best about it?” is a similar question for interns..
    - Does the candidate focus on solid relationships, or on technical factors?
    - Does their answer illustrate good soft-skill connection building (either their own or on the part of people they respected)?
    - Did this favorite work environment showcase good alignment skills and clarity of mission, or was it primarily a fun hangout?
    - The story told could also lead to follow-up questions relating to inclusivity and diverse perspectives. What does it show about candidate's approach to a modern workplace?

4. Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with one or more team members about how to proceed on a project. How did you go about resolving the issue? What did you learn? 
    - Does the candidate take an evidence-based approach to conflicts, or do they lean on soft skills?
    - Is the candidate able to deliver bad news or negative feedback when it is warranted? 
    - How much initiative did the candidate show in resolving the problem? Or did they need an intervention to get things sorted out?
    - The "what did you learn?" part is very important here, does this show a thoughtful response that builds skills?
    - When asking conflict-related questions, it’s important to see how frequently a candidate thinks the fault belongs exclusively to other people.
    - The answers here will be very different for junior and senior candidates, remember to be aware of the career context when parsing the candidate's answer.

5. I'd like to hear an example of a time when a coworker seemed very satisfied with the quality of their work, but you had to point out that it was not really adequate.  How did you go about telling them? How did you feel about it? What was the outcome?
    -  This is obviously about feedback skills, but it illustrates other skills as well. 
    -  Is this a person who approaches these situations intellectually or socially? 
    -  What steps did they take to de-personalize potential conflict?
    -  Is this someone who uses this kind of awkward situation as a teachable moment? Or perhaps somebody too invested in "winning" a conflict?
    -  If this is a TA vs artist story, does this show sensitive handling of creative differences?
    -  If this is a TA vs engineer story, how did the candidate make sure they understood all of the technical constraints?

6. Which project that you’ve worked on had the hardest time finding a common vision or goal? What made it so hard for the team to agree? How did you help resolve the issue? What did you learn?
    - Junior candidates may not have a good diagnosis, not having seen enough project settings. It may be interesting to hear how they dealt with a flailing team, but this is more likely a mid- to senior question.
    - The heart of the question is "what made it so hard to agree?"  How do they diagnose the misalignments that led to the problem in the first place: do they have a good eye for team dynamics? do they place all the blame on individuals, or do they look at team culture?
    - If the candidate’s first answer is about working with production artists, it might be worth asking a followup about working with engineers, or vice-versa. What does the difference between the answers tell about their approach to relatively more or less powerful collaborators?
    - If the story hinges on creative differences, what does it say about the TA's role in the creative process?

7. Tell me about a time when a team member was expecting something from you, but you were unable to deliver on time. How did you go about it? Did you take any steps to resolve the issue? What was the outcome? 
    - This one is a good index of both professionalism and of realism. How well does the candidate accept responsibility for a failure? Are they fairly objective about their own part in the problem? How did they deal with the negative consequences?
    - This can be a good opportunity to see if the candidate recognizes & values the ways in which their teammates behave under stress.
    - Junior candidates may be very intimidated by this question. For juniors it might be better to start with the opposite situation, when it was another party who dropped the ball, and then segue into this version. Does the candidate apply similar standards to their own behavior? Do both answers illustrate pragmatic approaches?

8. What do you think is your finest moment in supporting artists on your team? What’s the biggest hurdle you helped them overcome?
    - This one only really works for people with a studio background doing artist support work
    - Is the candidate somebody who focuses on technical help (“I wrote a tool to…”) on education (“I held a series of brown-bag tutorials…”) or on relationship building (“Once I got them to trust me, I…”) 
    - Does the way the candidate refers to colleagues indicate an inclusive mindset?  Or, conversely, is there a patronizing attitude towards production artists?
    - This can be especially useful question when interviewing riggers, who often have very demanding customer bases.

9. What was your biggest frustration in supporting artists? How did you work through the problem?
    - Again, for people with a studio background doing artist support work
    - Does the candidate’s answer show user empathy? Were they were frustrated on behalf of users? Or is it more of a perfectionist mindset ("the team picked a wrong approach")
    - Did the candidate try to fix the problem with tech, with social engineering, or by finding a way around it? 
    - Did they help to create alignment toward a new workflow or outcome in the end? Did they show leadership in making sure the problem did not recur?
    - Does the story show collaborative values? Or is this a scenario where advocacy and persistence or a technical intervention was the way forward?

10. How would you describe the difference between production artists and tech artists?
    - This question throws light on the candidate’s views of both disciplines. It's also a great index of how empathetic they can be for colleagues with different professional needs. 
    - Are they respectful and appreciative of the differences, or do they tend to be patronizing towards production artists? 
    - Does their view of tech art include a strong service component? Do they see themselves as enablers, or as independent technologists?
    - Have they been on both sides of the fence? Do they appreciate the pressures and obligations of their artist colleagues?
