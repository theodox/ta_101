  
A lot of tech people approach hiring the same way they approach shopping for a new computer.  You ponder your needs, you come up with a spec sheet, and you start looking around for that one sweet deal which has all the features you need.  "All we need," goes the hopeful thought, "is to really be clear about the role and responsbilities."

Unfortunately, that's not how hiring or team-building works.  

Here's a better analogy.  Hiring is, in a lot of ways, a lot like shopping for a new place to live. That, too, begins with requirements: often, let us say, an "optimistic" list along the lines of

>"we need a place near the #2 bus line, which takes dogs, has good internet, has a fair-trade coffee shop and a vegan bakery within walking distance, has AC, with a roof garden and a view of the lake."

After few weeks or months of searching that list of "must-haves" will usually have shrunk, often quite a bit.  The realities of what's on offer rarely live up to our hopes and dreams: it turns out there aren't a lot of vegans riding the #2, so some choices need to be made.  At the same time, the search process itself can reveal a few desirables that weren't on the initial list: "The bike storage in that place is really cool, I'd like if the place we pick has a good bike locker!"

At the end of the process you'll end up in a place which (hopefully) is recognizably similar to what you set out to find -- but rarely the thing you imagined when you start. The process of looking teaches you more about the distinction between what's vital ("we have to find a place for Fluffy!") and what's not really important ("ah, we'll just by a room AC for the bedroom").  Often, the critical selling points in the final decision emerged during the search itself -- it's not uncommon to wind up in a neighborhood that you didn't expect would suit you in practice.

There's a good deal to unpack in this analogy. On a purely human level, the house you didn't know you wanted often turns out to be better than the one you imagined: there is a lot to be said for learning from experience.  Applying the same thought to the hiring process has some interesting implications for the way you build a team.  Just like house-hunting, you're unlikely to get that dream candidate who has done exactly this role before in precisely they way you want it done and who is excited to do it again without a huge pay bump.  You'll need to learn how to adjust your expectations. but more importantly you'll also need to be open to the values and opportunities that come from a broader range of candidates.

Oh, and, like looking for a house -- there's going to be a lot of work, and a lot of borderline despair until things get settled.

All of this is why this doc was written: to help bring some clarity to the messy, emotionally taxing business of hiring people and building a team.  

## Defining a role

At the beginning of a housing search you're applying a lot of filters -- you don't have the time or energy to visit hundreds of places. But the more filters you apply, the smaller the pool of possible places becomes -- nowadays you can preview this in real time on any house-hunting website: the transition from overwhelming abundance to a worrisome lack of options happens really, really fast. The switch from "filtering" to "hunting"  will be familiar to most hiring managers. It's reflects the endless dialectic between the quest for the unicorn candidate and the increasing pressure that comes from an open position that sits idle too long.  

For most hiring managers that crossover is ref

Returning to the housing analogy, the latter part of the housing process is, ideally, more like what happens when you have loosened up your filters enough that you now have a few plausible options. Suddenly the binary process of filtering out places you don't want becomes the more complex and nuanced process of choosing between options with unique, and not directly comparable qualities. This part of the process calls for more reflection: is there really some objective way to balance, say, that vegan bakery with that really serene lake view? In a hiring decision, this is the part where you need to pick an individual, with all of their individual strengths and weaknesses. In both scenarios, you need to be self-conscious about your decision making process: do you have a clear view of the future you are helping create? This part the hiring prcoess is covered below under "final interviews."


One important thing to note before moving on: you'll notice that the analogy here does not resemble things like getting into college or passing the bar exam. At least for tech artists, who work in what is still a vert small field with a tremendous quotient of ongoing change, there's almost never going to be a simple metric for hiring. Even between two different teams in the same company there can be remarkably little that is clearly shared by people who all wear the same job title. There are real, useful commonalities among tech art jobs -- but they are not the kind of things you can spot by administering a simple standardized test. The questions below are designed to help a hiring manager or an interview crew spot those elusive qualities and how they fit into different team cultures.
